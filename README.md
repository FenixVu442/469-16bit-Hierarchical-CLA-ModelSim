# 16-bit Signed-Arithmetic Block with Hierarchical Carry Lookahead Adder

## Overview

This project focuses on the design and implementation of a 16-bit hierarchical Carry Lookahead Adder (CLA) for signed arithmetic operations. The goal was to create a robust arithmetic block with optimized resource utilization and structured design principles.

## Project Highlights

- **Skills Utilized:** SystemVerilog, CircuitVerse, ModelSim, Quartus, Git

## Key Features

1. **Efficient Design:** Orchestrated the development of a 16-bit CLA emphasizing high efficiency and optimal performance.

   **Inputs/Outputs:**
   
   Input:two 16-bit signed binary numbers.

   Output: SUM, DIFF, OVERFLOW_Sum Flag, OVERFLOW_Diff Flag, LessThan Flag
   
3. **Features:** Simutaneous Adder and Subtractor, with Overflow Flags and built-in logic for LessThan flag (Comparision between two numbers).

4. **Simulation Validation:** Conducted thorough ModelSim simulations to validate the functionalities of the designed 16-bit CLA, ensuring precise arithmetic operations.

6. **RTL Schematics:** Generated hierarchically organized RTL schematics using Quartus, providing clear insights into the modular nature of the design.

7. **TA Demonstration:** Successfully demonstrated the functionality of the 16-bit CLA to the TA, showcasing proficiency in FPGA programming and digital circuit design.

8. **Optimized Resource Utilization:** Implemented the entire system with no more than two 16-bit adders, emphasizing efficient resource usage.

9. **CircuitVerse Implementation:** https://circuitverse.org/users/142873/projects/16-bit-cla-hierarchical
